    <p>I was born and raised in Cyprus. I've always been dreaming to learn different languages, live and travel different countries. So it is not surprising that I am holding Bachelor Degree in Translation and Interpretation. During my study I went to United States of America to work and travel with my twin sister and we were only 21 years old. How crazy is that? I now think to myself and it’s pretty much crazy. I loved USA, as a huge tennis fun I went to US OPEN. Atmosphere was undeniably amazing and had chance to visit 3 states which are Los Angeles, New York and Las Vegas. <br><span> After I graduate I worked as a freelance translator and then worked in UK as self employed. Then got a job in Portugal. After the job became boring, I gave myself a TED talk that this life never will come back and I need to live the life that I want to live and seize all days, all hours and all seconds. So I decided to make my another dream come true which was going to Australia and spend 3 years with work and holiday visa. With my bestie of course (twin sis).  Yes you heard it right! However, covid came along and I couldn’t make it. YET! I was hired for Amazon in Ireland. It was a huge accomplishment for me. I was really flattered as being part of the Amazon.</span> <br> However, Australia again opened the doors to the visitors. So I deep down felt and thought that I need to take this opportunity to make my dreams come true. End of the 2022 I flew to Melbourne. No job no place to live and no one that I knew from there. Just took the risk. I am not going to say I had the best experience but it was worth it to take the risk. As a huge tennis fun, I went to Australian Open and watched Novak Djokovic in action. That’s was unforgettable moment for me. <br> <span>So yes that’s pretty much about me. <span>I am here to change my career as mostly because being able to work remotely. That's why you are reading my kind of about me page here.</span>
